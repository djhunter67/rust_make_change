# 100 DAYS of CODE
### Author: Christerpher Hunter

- I am mildly experienced using Python and I have a fair understanding of software development concepts.
- I am brand spanking new to the Rust programming language.  

## Day 3: Make Change

- This is an extremely simple program written in Rust that takes in a number grade and prints a letter grade.
- The Day two version will go from plain letter grades to using `+` and `-` criteria for grades.
- I will also explore `structs` and `impl` of the methods related to `structs`.

# Prompt
Let's convert a dollar amount into a number of coins. The input will be the total amount, the output will be the number of quarters, dimes, nickles, and pennies. Always break the total into the highest coin value first, resulting in the fewest amount of coins. First convert the dollar amount (1.36) into the total number of pennies (136), then use floor division `//`, which throws away the remainder. `10/3` is `3.333333`, `10//3` is `3`.
